# Hi, Tractian ðŸ§¢

This repository serves as a comprehensive test project created for the Tractian company. The project's main objective is to demonstrate my proficiency in Flutter development by integrating various libraries and technologies commonly used in the industry.

## Project Overview

The primary focus of this test project is to showcase the integration of different libraries and technologies within a Flutter app. The project includes the following features:

- **State Management with GetX:** Utilizes the GetX library for efficient state management, making it easier to manage app states and improve overall performance.

- **Synfusion Charts Integration:** Demonstrates the integration of Synfusion Charts library to create visually appealing and interactive data visualizations.

- **Drift for Local Data Persistence:** Utilizes the Drift library for local data persistence, providing seamless data storage and retrieval capabilities within the app.

- **Dio for HTTP Requests:** Incorporates the Dio library for making HTTP requests, allowing the app to communicate with remote APIs.

- **QR Code Reader (Pending Implementation):** The project includes the infrastructure for reading QR codes, including the necessary permissions setup. However, due to time constraints, the corresponding view for QR code reading is pending implementation.

## Areas for Improvement

Given more time, there are several areas in which improvements could be made to enhance the project:

1. **Refining Data Visualization:** The chart implementation could be further refined and enhanced to provide more interactive features and a better user experience.

2. **Improving Asset Details View:** The view responsible for displaying asset details could be refined to improve its visual presentation and user-friendliness.

3. **Enhancing Data Abstraction:** While the project currently utilizes companions for database abstraction, improvements could be made to handle data models more natively, reducing external dependencies.

4. **Fixing Order Status Bug:** There is a known bug in the order service display, where updating the status doesn't automatically refresh the listing. Given more time, this issue could be addressed.

5. **Adding Field Validations:** The order service insertion/editing view lacks field validation. Given more time, necessary field validations could be implemented to ensure data integrity.

## Architecture and Decoupling

The project prioritizes the decoupling of dependencies and the use of a well-defined architecture. This ensures that the app remains modular, scalable, and maintainable.
